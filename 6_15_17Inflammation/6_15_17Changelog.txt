Added inflammagen variable
Added inflammagen diffusion
Implemented inflammagen effect as equal to additional renewal per turn
Added inflammagen decay equal to (1-inflammagen_decay) (AFTER ENERGY RENEWAL IN EACH STEP)
Initialized inflammagen_decay to 0.1, just becuz
Updated doc

REMEMBER MATHWISE W THIS DECAY ALGORITHM equilibrium amount w/o diffusion is like (amount produced)/(decay rate).


ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO PATCH_INFLAMMATION CODE ONLY

Added patch_inflammagen
Implemented adding patch_inflammagen to the left side of the world
Added side-wise turtle population monitoring
Added sided analysis graph
Made inital cell distribution dynamic carrying capacity
Added 2 graphs
Updated doc

ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO CELL_INFLAMMATION CODE ONLY
Added inflammogenicity turtle quality, equal to inflammagen added per time step
Implemented inflammogenicity function
Initialized inflammogenicity to 0
Set up inflammogenicity evolution and sanity check

EXP1PATCHINFLAMMATIONDATA
Modified from PATCH_INFLAMMATION, has uniform inflammation and data export to csv, as well as porportion-based stop.
